Angular 

ng new RestfulTasks
C:\Users\ychod\sites\angularapp>cd RestfulTasks

C:\Users\ychod\sites\angularapp\RestfulTasks>

http.service.ts - Model
app.component.ts - controller
app.component.html - view


The ng build is to build artifacts.

The ng serve command is to pre-install packages and start the app.
for client you need to run ng build -w 


ng g s servicename  ( this could be http whic generates http.sevice.ts, http.service.spc.ts )
ng serve to run the server  if we are just using front end and not back end 


Make sure mongod.exe or mongo.exe is running or compass is running.

run nodemon server.js ( whatever js file for backend) in the backend (main) project folder.
ng build --watch if we are doing front end and backend at the same time. In this case the angular folder needs to be under the front end project folder
e.g. restfultasks folder in under restfulapi folder.
in this case we do npm start under the backend folder (restfulapi)
and ng build --watch under the front end folder. 

if we are running on 8000 port test by using 

localhost:8000

Make sure path is defined in server.js (js of the backend.
app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/RestfulTasks/dist/RestfulTasks"));

for error cannot bind to ngmodle since it is not known property of <input> div
if you are using input div make sure to add in app.module.ts
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';


ng g c componentname


Note : if you download a project from somewhere 
go to the project folder and do 'npm i' in it to build node-modules.
same thing for the client ( or whatever folder angular folder created by ng new ) for angular. Do 'npm i'
in the angular folder

to build a routing module for angular app when not created at the creation time do follwoing
go to the angular folder e.g. client in pur case. 
ng generate module app-routing --flat --module=app
